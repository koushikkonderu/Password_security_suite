        "# Password Strength Check\n",
        "\n",
        "This project evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria and provides feedback. Below is a simple explanation of how the code works:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Using Gradio for Web Interface**\n",
        "   - **Gradio** is used to create a user-friendly web interface for the password checker.\n",
        "   - The interface includes input fields for the password and a checkbox to toggle the visibility of the entered password.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Password Input Handling**\n",
        "   - A **textbox** is provided for users to input their password (`password_input`).\n",
        "   - A **checkbox** (`show_password`) toggles between showing or hiding the password characters.\n",
        "   - When the password changes, or the visibility toggles, the program evaluates the password strength in real-time.\n",
        "   - All the entered passwords are saved in password.txt file\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Evaluating Password Strength**\n",
        "   - The function `check_password_strength` uses **regular expressions** to assess specific password criteria:\n",
        "     - **Length:** Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long and gives additional points for 12+ characters.\n",
        "     - **Uppercase Letters:** Verifies the presence of uppercase letters (e.g., `A-Z`).\n",
        "     - **Lowercase Letters:** Verifies the presence of lowercase letters (e.g., `a-z`).\n",
        "     - **Numbers:** Checks if the password contains digits (`0-9`).\n",
        "     - **Special Characters:** Looks for special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Calculating Password Strength**\n",
        "   - The password strength is scored out of 6 based on the above criteria.\n",
        "   - A **percentage** is calculated for the score, representing the strength:\n",
        "     - **Weak (0-33%)**: Red meter.\n",
        "     - **Moderate (34-66%)**: Orange meter.\n",
        "     - **Strong (67-100%)**: Green meter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits\n",
        "- Helps users create strong and secure passwords.\n",
        "- Provides detailed feedback for improvement.\n",
        "- Interactive and easy to use.\n"
